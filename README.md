# Amazon-WebScrape

This is a Web Scrape of Amazon Web Store, in order to monitor the price of one specific item (Apple's MacBook was chosen for the example).

Feel free to use the code to get info about any item you want.

If you're going to use it, remember to update your personal data in the code, such as your User-Agent info and the email used to get updated when the item you chose 
hit the price you have defined. :)

Running this WebScrape can return no-values in case of bad usage, sending too much requests in a low interval can make you get IP banned from Amazon, due to their policy.
